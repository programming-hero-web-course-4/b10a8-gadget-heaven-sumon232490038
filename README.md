## Project Description

## Technologies used

First I used React to make this website then I took the help of a website for icons then I used CSS technology
Then used fake data which I did through technology called Chat GPT
I deployed the website with agin surge and again used netlify then event mandela

## 3 key features

1.I have used React-Toastify Alert which makes the alert look very nice

2.There is a button on this website which on multiple clicks adds unlimited coins to the account through which you can purchase any player but not more than six players.

3.This web site has a button called choode player which click on the button to complete many tasks. For example, if the player is already purchased then a warning alert will show, if the player is purchased then a success alert called congratulation will show.
